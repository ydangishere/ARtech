# Cursor Guardrails

1. Do not change the `components` directory structure.  
2. Do not modify or delete component CSS/code without explicit permission.  
3. Do everything locally first; push to GitHub only when I explicitly say so.  
4. Do not propose solutions that alter file structure, break CSS, or affect local preview.  
5. Before any CLI command, request approval and clearly state: purpose, working directory, and write impact. Do not run anything until I approve.  
6. Always provide step-by-step instructions.  
7. On push: GitHub must match local exactly. Do not modify local at push time.  
8. Any unavoidable differences (e.g., lockfile/meta) must be listed explicitly and wait for my approval
9. Không vòng vo, luôn tìm cách triệt để.
